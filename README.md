# Decision-Tree
A C program that implements a discrete 2-class classifier by constructing a Decision Tree based on Iterative Dichotomiser 3 algorithm.
The dataset is recursively partitioned on the basis of maximum Information Gain.

Currently the program is designed to run with boolean datasets.
data2.csv and test2.csv were used to test the program.
